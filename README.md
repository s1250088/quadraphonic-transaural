# quadraphonic-transaural
## **Abstract**
A transaural system allows to reproduce binaural sounds via loudspeakers. In our lab, we have created a Pure-data object that implements a transaural system for the speakers in front of the listener. The problem with the previous program is that when the listener moves, the spatialization is destroyed. This study aims to improve the spatialization of transaural objects by selecting two active loudspeakers depending on the azimuth of the listener.
The HRIR database is required to compile this program.
Download the HRIR database file to be used from the following URL and save it in the same directory as the program.
